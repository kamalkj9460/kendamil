Gas, constipation, and fussiness are fairly common reactions to a new formula. Because of this, we recommend introducing the new formula gradually by slowly swapping bottles of the current or “old” formula with Kendamil, starting with the midday feeds first and not the feeds before bed. This schedule can be alternated a bit based on the number of feedings. as some infants will feed for more or fewer feeds than indicated below: <\/p><p>Day 1: Feed 2 = Kendamil, remaining feeds are old formula<\/p><p>Day 2: Feeds 2 & 3 = Kendamil, remaining feeds are old formula<\/p><p>Day 3: Feeds 2, 3, & 4 = Kendamil, remaining feeds are old formula<\/p><p>Day 4: Feeds 1, 2, 3, & 4 = Kendamil, remaining feeds are current old formula<\/p><p>Day 5: All feeds = Kendamil<\/p><p>You can switch to the new formula immediately and prepare all the feeds with the new formula on Day 1. Feedback from parents using Kendamil has shown that switching to all Kendamil bottles within 24 hours is feasible. However, for some infants, it might be easier for their digestive system to transition slowly as described above.<\/p><p>We do recommend speaking to your healthcare professional before making any changes to your little one’s diet that you are concerned about.<\/p>","icon":""}},"581f63d7-2f50-4d45-9350-6f6603283d3b":{"type":"text","disabled":true,"settings":{"title":"How much does Kendamil cost?","description":"<p>Kendamil Classic 900g (32oz) will be priced at $33.99 and Kendamil Organic 800g (28oz) will be priced $39.99.  <\/p><p>This price per ounce of formula is comparable to market leading brands in the US and is more competitive than the majority of new startup brands.<\/p><p>Our guiding vision is, and always has been, that whilst our product is of superior quality it should be one that is accessible for all to enjoy so whilst retail pricing is at the discretion of the retailer we are working hard with them to ensure that Kendamil is accessible for all parents. <\/p><p>We're here for families. <\/p>","icon":""}},"16541575158ed1bf53-0":{"type":"text","settings":{"title":"Why do you use whole milk?","description":"<p>Kendamil’s unique whole milk recipe provides a more naturally-derived fat source for your baby and reduces the amount of vegetable oils in our formula (we proudly use no palm oil, fish oil or soya).<\/p><p>Whole milk also uniquely provides your little one a natural source of Milk Fat Globule Membrane (or MFGM), as identified in human breastmilk and uniquely included in Kendamil’s whole-milk recipe.<\/p>","icon":""}},"16541575158ed1bf53-1":{"type":"text","settings":{"title":"Does Kendamil contain palm oil?","description":"<p>We are proud that no Kendamil products contain palm oil (or fish oil or soya for that matter).<\/p><p>Studies have shown that the consumption of palm oil is linked to the malabsorption of minerals like calcium, leading to lower bone density. <\/p><p>Sadly, palm oil has also been linked to devastating environmental damage, threatening our rainforest and wildlife populations.
